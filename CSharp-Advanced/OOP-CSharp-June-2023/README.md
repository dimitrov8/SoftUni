# C# OOP Course - May 2023

**C# OOP** course at **Software University**. Below is a quick overview of what I've learned and studied during the course.

## Key Learnings

- **Inheritance**: Explored and implemented inheritance, understanding how to create hierarchical relationships between classes for code reuse and extensibility.
  
- **Encapsulation**: Mastered the principles of encapsulation, learning to hide the internal state of objects and restrict access to their internal details.

- **Interfaces and Abstraction**: Studied the use of interfaces and abstraction, enabling the creation of flexible and scalable software components.

- **Polymorphism**: Dived into polymorphism, understanding how to write code that can work with objects of multiple types and classes.

- **Exceptions and Error Handling**: Explored practical approaches to handling exceptions and errors, ensuring robust and error-tolerant code.

- **SOLID**: Understood and applied SOLID principles for object-oriented design, fostering maintainability and scalability in software projects.

- **Reflection and Attributes**: Learned about reflection and attributes, exploring ways to inspect and interact with metadata in C#.

- **Unit Testing**: Implemented unit testing strategies, ensuring the reliability and correctness of code through automated testing.
 
- **Mocking and Test Driven Development**: Explored the basic concepts of mocking and test-driven development (TDD), enhancing my skills in software testing and development.
